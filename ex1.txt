The first major problem in calculus was the tangent line problem. We now turn to the second major problem in calculus, the area problem. We saw that the derivative solved the tangent line problem and it turns out that the anti-derivative solves the area problem. Let f(x) be a non-negative, continuous function on the interval [a,b]. The area problem asks us to find the area under the graph of y=f(x) over the interval [a,b]. To solve this problem, we begin by approximating the area under the curve using rectangles. The sum of the areas of these rectangles is called a Riemann Sum.
